## Description
Pig Dice is a simple game that two players can play against each other. The objective is to be the first one to reach a total score of 100. Here ,Player1 can play by clicking the ROLL button and a number will be generated. At this point, the player can choose to either play another round, provided that they did not roll a 1, which would result in a total of zero points, or they can choose to click the HOLD button.The HOLD button will prompt Player 2 to click the ROLL button, where they get a chance to roll the dice and play. The cycle goes on up until one of the players reaches 100 points, and at that point that player will be the winner.
