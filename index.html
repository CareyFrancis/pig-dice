          <p class="p1">Each turn, a player repeatedly rolls a die until either a 6 is rolled or the player decides to hold:
            <ul>
              <li>If the player rolls a 6, they score nothing and it becomes the next player's turn.</li>
              <li>If the player rolls any other number, it is added to their turn total and the player's turn continues.</li>
              <li>If a player chooses to "hold", their turn total is added to their score, and it becomes the next player's turn.</li>
            </ul>
